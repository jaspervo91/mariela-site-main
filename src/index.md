# Hello, I’m Mariela

<p class="lede">I’m a classical singer, musicologist and singing teacher based in the Netherlands.</p>

I have a particular enthusiasm for baroque music, especially its research and interpretation. In the projects I’m involved with, I enjoy incorporating other art forms such as visuals, theatre, painting, and literature.

Now you know what I’m about, send me an email and tell me about your project or any opportunities you have in mind!
